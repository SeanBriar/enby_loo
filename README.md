EnbyLoo is an app designed to help non-binary, trans*, and gender non-conforming folks find all-gender restrooms in the Sacramento area. The app features a search function and a map to help make finding locations easier. 

### Methods
The first step to creating this app was to build the backend and seed the database. I then tested all the routes with Postman and made sure the backend was correct. After that I moved on to the front end where I created a wireframe and general page layout. First I wrote static React components, and then later made them functional with functions ands state. As the process went on I styled with CSS and then with Sass. 

### Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails backend
- Postgres database
- React frontend
- Sass styling
- Route testing with Postman

### Future Updates
Ways to improve this app would be to build dynamic map functionality where a newly added location would be rendered on the map without hardcoding. Another idea is to made to the map render on the show page and to have the location pinned dynamically.
